# Learning Process Assignment

## Question 1  
### What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.  
I use the Feynman Technique to learn and relearn concepts by teaching them in simple terms.

## Question 2  
### In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?  
The most interesting idea for me was how **sleep plays a major role in learning and memory**. It made me realize that learning is not only about studying harder, but also about giving the brain enough rest to process and store information properly.

Another thing I found interesting was the idea of **procrastination and habit loops**, because it explains why we delay important work even when we know it is necessary. It helped me understand that procrastination is not just laziness, but something our brain does naturally when it looks for comfort or quick dopamine.

## Question 3  
### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?  

**Active (Focused) Mode:**  
When I work in active mode, I focus completely on the problem in front of me. I use this mode when I am coding, debugging, studying a concept, or solving logical problems. It is direct and concentrated thinking.

**Diffused Mode:**  
When I work in diffused mode, I feel relaxed and my brain starts connecting ideas naturally. This mode helps me understand concepts better without forcing my mind too much.  

I personally relate to diffused thinking because I walk at least **3 hours a day**, and many times I get solutions or clarity about coding problems while walking. I may not even be actively thinking about the problem, but the answer comes automatically.

## Question 4  
### According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.  
- Deconstruct the skill into smaller parts  
- Learn enough to self-correct  
- Remove practice barriers and distractions  
- Practice consistently for at least 20 hours

## Question 5  
### What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?  

To improve my learning process going forward, I will take these actions:

- I will stay consistent in practice instead of learning randomly with long gaps.  
- I will reduce procrastination by starting tasks early instead of waiting for the "perfect mood".  
- I will use the Feynman Technique to explain concepts in simple words so I can clearly identify what I know and what I don’t.  
- I will focus more on learning by doing, especially through drills and assignments, because practice is what actually builds skill.  
- Whenever I feel distracted, I will use the [20-second “do nothing” reset technique by Andrew Huberman (my favorite)](https://youtube.com/shorts/0zQaNicTyCM?si=W0RfSe3LzS0ackRQ)
- I will start tracking my study time so I can measure my consistency and improve my discipline.
